# Ryde

One of the mobile applications that I have built implementing the MVC pattern is using Swfit and Ruby and MVC.

Ryde is a non-profit ride-sharing application inspired by Uber and Lyft. <br/>
This app is avaible only in IOS TestFlight (send me a for invite)

![app pages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IMS-Studio/Ruby-Swift-MVC-APP-Project/main/Ride-Sharing-App/Gif_Of_App.gif)
The left simulator represents a driver and the right simulator represents a passenger.<br/>
A passenger sends a request and a driver accepts that incoming request. <br/> When a driver arrives at that passenger's location, a driver presses the ARRIVED button to notify that passenger.
